XOSC

Connect different OSC capable programs, considering the situation where you have two programs talking via OSC, but then want to have a third or fourth application to also use OSC from those same applications, without having to rewrite code.

Solution:
Just change the target host/port to send OSC to, to XOSC, and XOSC will allow you to patch OSC between applications.

- XOSC does not require any changes to original software to use it

- XOSC has an OSC interface to create connections.

- XOSCope - provides a user interface for showing and creating connections.

- (intra-XOSC) Several instances of XOSC can communicate with each other to create connections between them.

- (net-XOSC) Something like OSC-Groups will allow for communication over the net.

COMPONENTS:
- XOsc    - server application which takes care of connections - controlled by osc
- libxosc - provides additional functionality to subscribe and manage connections

IMPLEMENTATION AND INTERFACE

* generic OSC handler 
  which listens to incoming OSC messages, and stores the address-tags, with info from where they came (host+port), and what type tags they have. Either of these characteristics can change per address-tag.
  - register an OSC handler, which will forward the message to the indicated host/port
  - and be able to remove it again when a connection is broken


* OSC interface to manage connections
(- not implemented yet; ? still considering whether to implement)

------- advanced -------
--- maybe as a separate program... compare libmapper, e.g. for file formats
* tag renaming/filtering/mapping (a la libmapper - see how far this needs to go)
    */tag/retag  - make/break connection for specific tag, and rename it.(+ args: new tagname
    */tag/filter - make/break connection for specific tag, and filter arguments (add. args: ids for slots of original data)
    */tag/retag/filter - make/break connection for specific tag, and rename it, and filter arguments (add. args: new tagname, ids for slots)
    */tag/map    - make/break connection and rescale data
    */tag/retag/map
    */tag/filter/map
    */tag/retag/filter/map
