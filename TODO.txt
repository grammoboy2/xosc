TODO list:
 
TO ADD: 
-- connections by hostname/clientname
 - keep a list of hostnames/clientnames

-- to add: /query/connections/client
 -- question: how to store connections, or iterate over tags and hosts...
 
 
 
TO FIX:

Currently clients and hosts are kept in memory based on their port
number, so possibly there are conflicts when mapping between different
hosts. This should be fixed by providing a different lookup method.

Similarly multiple clients sending the same tags might provide problems.
